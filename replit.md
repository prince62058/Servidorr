## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript
- **Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for responsive design and UI components
- **Animation Libraries**: AOS (Animate On Scroll) for scroll-triggered animations
- **Font Integration**: Google Fonts (Inter and Poppins) and Font Awesome icons
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with viewport meta tags

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with proper meta tags and accessibility considerations
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features for modern JavaScript functionality
- **Bootstrap 5**: Component library for rapid UI development
- **External Libraries**: AOS for animations, Font Awesome for icons
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- **Backend Ready**: Database schema and storage layer prepared for full-stack functionality

## Key Components

### 1. Navigation System
- Fixed navigation bar with scroll effects
- Active link highlighting
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

### 2. Animation Engine
- **Scroll Animations**: Intersection Observer API for performance
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive elements with CSS transitions
- **Parallax Effects**: Depth and movement on scroll
- **Counter Animations**: Number counting effects
- **Morphing Shapes**: Dynamic visual elements
- **Stagger Animations**: Sequential element animations
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth navigation between sections

### 3. Service Booking Features
- Service filtering and categorization
- Booking form with validation
- Contact form functionality
- Service tabs for different categories
- Countdown timers for promotions

### 4. User Experience Elements
- Loading screen with spinner
- Back-to-top button
- Floating elements for visual interest
- Reveal animations for content disclosure

## Data Flow

### Client-Side Flow
1. **Page Load**: Loading screen displays while assets load
2. **Navigation**: User clicks navigation links triggering smooth scroll
3. **Service Selection**: Users browse and filter available services
4. **Booking Process**: Form validation and submission handling
5. **Visual Feedback**: Animations provide user interaction feedback

### Animation Flow
1. **Scroll Detection**: Intersection Observer monitors element visibility
2. **Animation Trigger**: CSS classes applied based on scroll position
3. **Stagger Effects**: Sequential animations for grouped elements
4. **Completion Callbacks**: Post-animation cleanup and state management

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: CSS framework for responsive design
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Inter and Poppins font families
- **AOS 2.3.1**: Animate On Scroll library

### Database Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for data storage
- **Drizzle ORM**: Modern TypeScript ORM for database operations
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Database driver for serverless PostgreSQL connections

### Performance Considerations
- Preconnect hints for Google Fonts
- Optimized loading order for CSS and JavaScript
- Lazy loading for non-critical animations
- Database connection pooling for efficient data access

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **Architecture**: Client-side only, no server-side processing
- **Requirements**: Any static web server (CDN, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
- **Assets**: All resources loaded from CDN for faster delivery
- **Caching**: Browser caching for static assets

### Build Process
- **No Build Step**: Direct deployment of source files
- **Optimization**: Manual CSS/JS minification recommended for production
- **SEO**: Meta tags and semantic HTML for search engine optimization

### Database Integration
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Fully configured with environment variables
- **Schema Design**: Complete database schema for users, services, bookings, service providers, and contact inquiries
- **Storage Layer**: TypeScript storage interface with database operations
- **Sample Data**: Pre-populated with service categories and pricing information

### Scalability Considerations
- **Backend Integration**: Database and storage layer ready for API integration
- **Database**: Full database schema implemented with proper relationships
- **Authentication**: Frontend prepared for user authentication flows
- **Real-time Features**: Database structure supports booking management and user interactions

## Development Notes

### Code Organization
- **Modular JavaScript**: Separate files for main functionality and animations
- **CSS Architecture**: Custom properties for consistent theming
- **Component Structure**: Reusable UI patterns throughout the application

### Future Enhancements
- Backend API integration for real booking functionality
- User authentication and profile management
- Payment processing integration
- Real-time availability checking
- Service provider dashboard

The application is designed to be easily extended with backend services while maintaining the current user experience and animation system.
